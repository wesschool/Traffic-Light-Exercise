# Traffic-Light-Exercise
The Exercise: A traffic light has a red light, yellow light, and a green light. The traffic light only has one of the three lights on at any given time. The order of the lights when they change is from Red to Green, Green to Yellow, and Yellow to Red. Create a TrafficLight class that simulates the traffic light described. The TrafficLight has a method named changeLight that changes the current light that is on to the next light being on using the order described. Implement this without using any if statements or switch and case statements.
